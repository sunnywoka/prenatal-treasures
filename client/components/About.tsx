          Hi, my name is Yuekai Wu. Welcome to my designed website, Prenatal
          Treasures. This website aims to help new parents record their wish
          list for their incoming babies. My wife, Wenxiao, and I are expecting
          our first baby, Mary, in December, and this website is made with love
          for Wenxiao and Mary.
        </p>

        <p className="text-left">
          The website is for all parents who love their children!
