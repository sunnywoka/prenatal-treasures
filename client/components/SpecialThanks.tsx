        A very special thanks to Rodolfo Us√≥ Delduca, who provided the idea to
        create this lovely website. Rod, your idea for this website inspired me.
        Thanks as well to the entire cohort of mates and the facilitators in
        Matai-2023 for their support and help during the lovely 17 weeks at Dev
        Academy.
