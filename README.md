## Project Objective

The Prenatal Treasures is my personal project designed to provide support and assistance in preparing for the arrival of a newborn baby. It was created out of the necessity to have a convenient and efficient tool for tracking baby and mummy essentials. The goal is to streamline the process of organising and managing the items needed for your new family member.

## Motivation
After struggling to find a suitable app for tracking baby and mummy essentials, I decided to take matters into my own hands and build a solution tailored to the specific needs of my family. This application aims to provide a hassle-free experience for my wife and me, ensuring that we have everything in place for the arrival of our baby.

## Current Features
- **Simple Interface**: The app boasts a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to add items for future purchases.

- **Efficient Entry**: Users can swiftly input item names and press Enter for quick entry, saving time and effort.

- **Edit Functionality**: You can easily modify item details such as price and quantity, ensuring accuracy in your planning.

- **Sorting and Filtering**: The application allows users to sort and find items based on different criteria and categories, providing flexibility in organisation.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-end**: Built using React, React Query, and Tailwind CSS, the project leverages modern web technologies for a seamless user experience.

- **Authentication**: Auth0 is implemented for user sign-up and login, ensuring secure access to the application.

- **Data Storage**: SQLite3 is utilised for efficient and reliable data storage, ensuring that your information is stored securely.

## Future Plans
The Prenatal Treasures project is continuously evolving, and there are several exciting features in the pipeline:

- **Printable Item Lists**: We plan to expand the functionality to allow users to print item lists, providing a convenient physical reference.

- **Social Features**: Implementation of Auth0 for social features will enhance the collaborative aspect of the application, allowing for shared lists and collaborative planning.

- **Enhanced User Experience**: I am dedicated to improving the design elements to further enhance the user experience, ensuring that the app remains intuitive and user-friendly.

Thank you for using the Prenatal Treasures! We hope it brings as much convenience to your family as it has to ours.
